# TransportProtocolTextManipulator

This program implements a network-based application to support text splitting and merging. A client can send a string to the server and ask for the string to be split into vowels and non-vowels or the client can send a vowel and non-vowel string to be merged together. Data will be sent and received using TCP or UDP.
